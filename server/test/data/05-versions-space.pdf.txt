INTRODUCTION
Many people are afraid of snakes, even people
with a well-developed awareness of the environ-
ment and the natural world. This is unfortunate:
the average snake that turns up in a backyard or
on a pond shore (or even in a cellar) should not
be regarded as any more frightening than a chip-
munk. We hope that this publication will dispel
some of the fear of snakes... a fear rooted in a lack
of accurate information. We think that most
people, once equipped with a little knowledge
and understanding of these beautiful, interesting
and inoffensive animals, will find that there is
nothing left to fear.
History of Snakes
Snakes are the most modern of reptiles, first
appearing in the fossil record during the time of
the dinosaurs. It is thought that they evolved from
ground dwelling or burrowing lizards that ex-
ploited the survival advantages to be found in a
cylindrical, legless body. They gave up external
ears and developed clear scales to shield their
ever-open eyes from dust and damage. They
evolved elongated internal organs, specialized
muscles and resilient, scaled skins of varied pattern
and color that provided camouflage and some
limited protection from predators and the ele-
ments. They also evolved a host of instinctive
behaviors that enabled them to find and catch
prey, hide from predators, reproduce and survive
in a great variety of climates. Tunnelling beneath
dirt and sand, swimming in the seas, climbing in
the crowns of trees and crawling on the land,
snakes became integral components of varied
ecosystems throughout the world. Some evolved
infrared heat sensors to find prey in the darkness
of night or burrow. Some developed venoms (and
the apparatus to deliver them) of such exquisite
complexity and design that — unlike most bio-
chemical substances — they cannot yet be manu-
factured through biotechnology or genetic engi-
neering. In short, snakes are incredibly successful,
unique and remarkable animals, well deserving of
our respect and admiration.
Why, then, do so many people burden them-
selves with an irrational, senseless fear of snakes
and an unwarranted prejudice toward them? The
answer lies in the power and longevity of myth.
For centuries, snakes have figured prominently
in the religions, customs and folklore of people
throughout the world. To early humans, snakes
must have possessed seemingly magical, almost
supernatural attributes. They had the ability to
move without legs over and through all types of
terrain, vegetation and water. They had the ability
to find, capture and eat prey without the aid of
appendages, as well as to periodically shed an old
skin and the ravages of time to reveal a new,
brightly hued mantle. They could arise in the spring,
resurrected from the ice of winter, and, in a few
cases, could cause sickness or death with a single
bite. A science fiction writer could scarcely ask for
a better model, so it is not surprising that snakes
gave rise to all manner of tall tales and myths.
The fear of snakes is an old, deeply entrenched
form of prejudice, born of ignorance and perpetu-
ated through superstition and myth. It is time that
we stop judging these fascinating reptiles on the
basis of folklore and ignorance.
MYTHOLOGY
Some cultures held snakes in high esteem as
powerful religious symbols. Quetzalcoatl, the
mythical “plumed serpent,” was worshipped as the
“Master of Life” by ancient Aztecs of Central
America. Some African cultures worshipped rock
pythons and considered the killing of one to be a
Cows, monkeys and dogs are revered by some
cultures yet consumed as food by others. So, too,
snakes are respected in some parts of the world
and despised in others. The way that people feel
about snakes is heavily influenced by cultural
beliefs and mythology.

serious crime. In Australia, the Aborigines associ-
ated a giant rainbow serpent with the creation
of life.
Other cultures have associated
snakes with medicinal powers or
rebirth. In India, cobras were
regarded as reincarnations
of important people
called Nagas. Our
modern medical
symbol of two
snakes wrapped
around a staff, or
‘caduceus,’ comes

Stories about New England water snakes eight and
ten feet long are simply not true. Northern water
snakes rarely exceed three and a half feet in
length, with the largest stretching only four and a
half feet. While the black rat snake, our largest
native snake, can reach lengths of just over eight
feet, most New England snakes are less than three
feet long.
Venomous Snakes. The regularity with which
people kill a snake first and ask questions later
might lead you to believe that the world is overrun
with venomous snakes. In fact, venomous snakes
only make up about 10 percent of snake species
worldwide, and in Massachusetts only two of the
state’s fourteen species of snakes are venomous
(timber rattlesnake and northern copperhead).
Both are rare, reclusive and generally confined to
isolated areas.
Folk Tales. Folk tales
about snakes are handed
down from generation to
generation and include
such things as snakes that
charm prey, swallow their
young for protection, poison
people with their breath, roll
like hoops, and suck milk from
cows. These folk tales could be
just interesting and amusing stories
except that many people still believe
them. As we learn more about the true
nature of snakes, we can begin to base
our perceptions of them on fact rather
than fiction.
from ancient
Greek mythology.
According to the
Greeks, the mythical figure
Aesculapius discovered medicine by watching as
one snake used herbs to bring another snake back
to life.
Judeo-Christian culture has been less kind to
snakes. Tales of the Garden of Eden and the
serpent’s role in “man’s fall from grace” have
contributed to a negative image of snakes in
western culture. In Appalachia, some Christians
handle venomous snakes as part of ritual ceremo-
nies, relying on faith to protect them from bites.
Among Catholics, Saint Patrick is credited with
ridding Ireland of snakes, a feat
celebrated by many as a good
thing.
Deep rooted cultural
biases may be responsible, in
part, for widespread fear and
disdain for snakes. However,
modern myths, from folk tales to
plain old misinformation, also
contribute to their negative image.
Modern Myths
Size. Snakes are almost always de-
scribed as larger than they really are.
MYTH: HOOP SNAKES
Myth:  When frightened, hoop snakes will bite their
tails and roll downhill like a wagon wheel.
Reality: 
 Anatomically, snakes are not well
equipped for rolling and there are no reliable
accounts of this ever occurring. The hoop snake
myth may have been associated originally with
mud snakes found in the southern United States.
Mud snakes will occasionally lie in a loose coil
shaped like a hoop, but they slither away from
danger like other snakes.

REALITY
In Massachusetts we have fourteen
species of native snakes. Most of
them, even as adults, are less
than three feet long, and
several are generally less
than a foot in length. None of
them are aggressive, although
— like most animals — they will
defend themselves if threatened,
injured or captured. Even then,
the defensive maneuvers of several
species are nothing more offensive
than releasing foul-smelling anal
secretions. Other species attempt to
frighten or intimidate potential enemies
through bluff: flattening their heads, puffing up
their bodies, rattling their tails or hissing. In self
defense, some will indeed bite, but except in the
case of our two extremely rare, venomous species,
the resulting wounds are superficial. Our nonven-
omous snakes all possess short, thin, very sharp
teeth that leave clean, shallow wounds (rarely
requiring even a bandage), and which — unlike
the bites of mammals — carry 
no threat of disease.
The important thing to remember is that unless you
attempt to harm or capture a snake, it is almost
impossible to get bitten. You have a better chance
of being struck by lightning.
Reproduction
Depending on the species, snakes may be egg-
layers or give birth to live young. They generally
mate in the spring, shortly after leaving whatever
hollow, burrow or rock crevice has sheltered them
through winter hibernation. Egg-la
yers usually
deposit their clutches (groups of eggs) in dirt,
beneath stones or logs, or in piles of decaying
wood or vegetation during late spring or early
summer. Most snakes hatch or are born in late
summer. Whether deposited as eggs or dropped
as fully formed miniature adults, snakes are on
their own from the start. Our snakes do not take
any responsibility for the care and protection of
their young. Most snakes mature at one or two
years of age, and individuals may live up to
twenty years in the wild.
MYTH: SWALLOWING YOUNG
Myth:  When confronted with danger, mother
snakes swallow their young, spitting them out later
once danger has passed.
Reality: 
 Parental care is not very well developed
in snakes and there is no evidence that mother
snakes protect their young in this way. The myth
may result from the fact that some snakes eat
young snakes of their own species or of other
species, though usually not their own brood.
Habitat
Our native snakes occupy a
wide range of habitats, including:
fields, forests, wetlands, ponds, lakes, streams,
rocky hillsides, farmland, vacant lots and residential
neighborhoods. Within those habitats, snakes may
travel along the ground, swim, climb trees and
bushes, and venture below ground. Although some
snakes do burrow, most “snake holes” are pro-
duced by chipmunks, mice, shrews and other small
mammals. Many snakes utilize these burrows for
food, shelter and egg laying sites, but most species
don’t dig holes.
“Cold-blooded”
Although it is said that snakes are “cold-blooded,”
it is more accurate to say that they are unable to
regulate their body temperatures by generating
heat. During the active season they are rarely cold

and are surprisingly good at regulating their
temperatures through behavior. Snakes can warm
themselves by basking in the sun, lying under
rocks or boards that are in the sun, or by lying
on rocks and pavement that hold the heat after
dark. When the air temperature is too hot, they
seek shelter in small mammal burrows, under
rocks and occasionally in cool cellars.
A Link in the Food Chain
Snakes are important components
of natural ecosystems. Common
in many types of habitat,
they affect the “balance
of nature” as both
predators and
prey.
it down, others through ambush, and, although
it is not known for certain, most species prob-
ably scavenge dead prey as well. Some species
kill their prey through 
venomous bites, others by
constriction, still others by simply overpowering
and then swallowing their prey. Lacking any
chewing teeth, all snakes swallow their meals
whole. Depending on the size of the meal and
the temperature of their resting habitat, our
native snakes may eat as often as several times a
day or as rarely as once a month.
Snakes and their eggs are in turn eaten by fish,
amphibians, other snakes, birds and predatory
mammals such as skunks, raccoons and opossums.
Birds are their most serious predators — and not
just hawks and owls. Songbirds consume
great numbers of small snakes and
it is not unusual to see the tail of
a young garter snake dangling
from the overstuffed gullet
of a nestling robin!
All snakes are predators. Depending on size
and species, they may feed on invertebrates such
as slugs, worms and insects, or on fish, amphib-
ians, snakes, birds, bird eggs and small mammals.
Species such as the milk snake and black rat snake
consume great numbers of rodents, and their
presence around barns is of great benefit to farm-
ers. In particular, the milk snake regularly enters
burrows and will consume young mice and rats
right in the nests. Garter, redbelly and brown
snakes frequently consume garden pests such as
slugs and certain soft-bodied insects.
Snakes find their prey by sight and scent, and
sometimes temperature. Except for burrowing
species, snakes have excellent short-range vision.
Their sense of smell is extraordinary, thanks to a
harmless, constantly flicking forked tongue that
carries scent particles to a specialized sensory
organ (‘Jacobson’s organ’) on the roof of the
mouth. 
Some species catch their prey by hunting
Myth: Snakes have the ability to charm prey,
especially birds, so they cannot flee.
Reality:
  There is no evidence that snakes charm
their prey. Small animals may become “frozen
with fear” when confronted by snakes but they
are not charmed. Birds may flutter about in front
of a snake in an attempt to lure it away from their
nests; occasionally a bird may actually be captured
by the snake, giving the impression that it was
charmed. The fact that snakes never blink may
also have played a role in this myth’s origin.

MORE ABOUT SNAKES
Common Snakes
While it is unlikely you will ever find a venomous
snake in Massachusetts, odds are good that if you
spend any time outdoors you will eventually
encounter one or more species of harmless snakes.
Five common snakes account for the majority of
sightings in Massachusetts.
Undoubtedly, the most commonly encountered
snake is the garter snake. This prolific, adaptable
species thrives in suburban habitats and often
utilizes the shelter provided by shrubbery, mulch,
stonewalls and cracked masonry around houses.
Active by day, it is often observed in the morning,
warming itself on stairs and sidewalks exposed to
the sun.
prolific species and can be found in virtually all
pond, river and wetland habitats throughout the
state. Water snakes are often reported by home-
owners who find them in the spring as they
disperse from hibernation sites. Though large
individuals may look quite sinister with their
triangular heads and heavy bodies, these stocky
eaters of fish and frogs are harmless and should
not be confused with the venomous cottonmouth
“water moccasins” of the southeastern states.
The “blacksnake” or black racer is a long,
slender “sight-hunter” known for its speed and
agility. (Its top speed is actually only 3.6 miles per
hour.) It is usually encountered in rural habitats of
mixed brush, field and forest. Although this alert,
inquisitive reptile often raises its head up to ob-
serve approaching people or other disturbances
(and may even follow people for short distances to
satisfy its curiosity) it quickly turns tail and flashes
away at the slightest hint of danger.
“The Great Pretender”
Though relatively rare, a chance encounter with a
hognose snake is always memorable. This harm-
less “great pretender” puts on such a fearsome
display when alarmed that it actually looks and
sounds far more dangerous than either of our
venomous snakes! Sometimes called the “puff
adder,” this habitual eater of toads will inflate its
body, hiss loudly, lunge about ferociously and
spread a surprising cobra-like hood. Despite this
impressive appearance, it almost never bites.
5
MYTH: SUCKING MILK
Myth:  Milk snakes are so named because of their
ability to suck milk directly from the udders of cows.
Reality:  Although milk snakes are common
around barns that house cows, they completely
lack the anatomy necessary to suck milk (or
anything else for that matter). Barns are attractive
to milk snakes because they provide abundant
food in the form of small rats and mice.
The milk snake makes use of many of the
same habitats as the garter snake and will some-
times enter buildings in search of mice, its favored
prey. Though quite common, its secretive nature
and nocturnal habits make it less likely to be
encountered than the garter snake. Occasionally, it
can be seen sunning itself on spring and early
summer mornings.
A small, common, secretive species, the ring-
neck snake is rarely found in the open. This
inoffensive, pretty snake with the bright band
around its neck is sometimes encountered in damp
or dirt-floored basements that offer ample food in
the form of salamanders and insects.
Frequently encountered by fishermen and
boaters, the water snake is one of our most
MYTH: POISONOUS BREATH
Myth:  Puff adders (hognose snakes) mix poison with
their breath and can kill a person at a distance of
twenty-five feet.
Reality:  Although the bite of a hognose snake can
produce swelling and a burning sensation, these
snakes rarely bite people and are not considered
venomous. When confronted, they do puff them-
selves up and hiss, but their breath is harmless.

6
MYTH: COTTONMOUTHS IN NEW ENGLAND
Myth:  Swimmers in New England are advised to
watch out for venomous cottonmouths, also known
as water moccasins.
Reality: 
 Simply put, there are no water mocca-
sins in New England. The cottonmouth, or water
moccasin, is a venomous snake of the southeast-
ern United States that occurs no farther north
than the Great Dismal Swamp of Virginia. Many
people mistake nonvenomous water snakes for
water moccasins.
If this incredible bluff fails to drive off the
offender, the hognose will writhe about,
vomit, roll over on its back and let its
tongue loll out. In short, it puts on
the appearance of a thoroughly
dead snake. If turned upright,
the snake will immediately
roll on its back again.
When the
danger is past, however, the hognose will cau-
tiously raise its head, turn over, and be off about
its business.
Venomous Snakes
There are only two venomous snakes in
Massachusetts — the timber rattlesnake and the
copperhead. (Contrary to popular belief, there are
no venomous “water moccasins” in the Bay State,
only harmless water snakes.) Statewide, popula-
tions of our two endangered venomous snakes are
believed to number no more than a few hundred
individuals. Due to a host of problems, these
populations are probably still declining despite
rigorous efforts to protect them. Our “rattlers” are
now known to exist at only a dozen or so widely
scattered sites in mountainous regions of the state;
the distribution of copperheads is even more
restricted. As a result, most of Massachusetts is
completely devoid of venomous serpents.
The chance of receiving a venomous snake bite
is further reduced by the fact that both species are
shy and reclusive. Like all snakes, they will bite
people only in self defense. If you do not willfully
seek out and attempt to confront these species, the
chances of being bitten by either are negligible.
The toxicity of their venoms tends to be highly
overrated; only one person has ever died of
snakebite in Massachusetts, and that was
more than 200 years ago.
Always keep in mind that
many harmless snakes
resemble venomous snakes
in pattern and behavior.
Milk snakes, water snakes,
hognose snakes and other
banded or blotched species are
frequently mistaken for copper-
heads. Milk snakes, black racers and
black rat snakes are often misidentified
as rattlesnakes because they vibrate their
tails rapidly when alarmed. The over-
whelming majority of reports of en-
counters with venomous snakes in
New England are nothing more than
cases of mistaken identity.
Identification is the Key
Snakes encountered around the
home are almost certainly harmless and nonven-
omous. With just a little effort you can confirm this
with an identification. It is a simple matter to learn
to recognize our five common snakes at a glance.
More secretive and rarer species can be easily
identified through use of the identification guide
provided (pages 16-19). It is a curious fact that
when we have the ability to put a name to some-
thing and understand its motivations, it tends to
lose the power to frighten us.

Snakes Phobias
Some people have such an overwhelming, irration-
al fear of snakes that the phobia may restrict their
lifestyles. This fear — known as ophidiophobia —
may cause such people to avoid all areas where
there is the slightest chance that a serpent could
be encountered. Some cannot enjoy gardening or
their own backyards, let alone a hike in the coun-
try or a summer dip in the local pond. Many
victims of this phobia cannot view a movie or
photograph of a snake without experiencing acute
anxiety, and could not bear to read this publica-
tion. If you know such a person, let them know
that effective treatment is available. Tell them to
contact their doctor or local medical clinic for a
referral and get back to enjoying the outdoors!
Snakes In and Around
the Home
Despite the harmless and beneficial
nature of snakes, there are still some
people who, for whatever reasons,
want to discourage them from
inhabiting their yards. Through-
out the warm months — and
particularly in the spring
when the mating season
and the need to bask
causes snakes to be more
obvious than usual — we
get calls from people
wanting to get snakes
away from their homes. As with most things in life,
the solution requires tradeoffs which should be
thoughtfully weighed against the dubious inconve-
nience of having a snake or two around the yard.
While the adaptability and perseverance of our
common snakes makes them extremely difficult to
eliminate entirely, removing potential shelter can
significantly reduce the number of snakes in an
area. Shelter for snakes is almost anything close to
the ground that they can enter or get beneath to
avoid predators and extreme temperatures. Boards
on the ground, log and leaf piles, cracks and
crevices in foundations, rock walls, ground-

SNAKES AND PEOPLE

hugging shrubbery, dense patches of vegetation
and narrow spaces beneath decks and outbuildings
are all popular forms of cover. The number of
snakes around a home can be reduced by sealing
or removing some or all of these shelters, but use
common sense. A nearly snake-free yard would
have a wide, close-cut lawn extending right to a
tightly sealed foundation: no flower gardens, no
rocks, no shrubbery. Unless you really want to
surround yourself with a boring, uninviting land-
scape, it is much easier to live with an occasional
snake in the yard.
A snake in the house is another matter. While
milk snakes may live undiscovered in rock founda-
tions for generations and the pretty little “ring-
necks” may survive comfortably amid the debris of
a dirt-floored crawl-space, most snakes — espe-
cially garter snakes — end up in houses by acci-
dent. They cannot live in such habitats for long.
Most are victims of falls and a poor sense of
direction. They usually turn up in the spring,
having hibernated in the foundation and emerged
on the wrong side of the wall.
A snake in the house — especially in the
typically jumbled cellar — is not an easy animal to
locate. If it’s any consolation, the snake will prob-
ably avoid living areas. If you can find it, check to
be certain that it is a harmless snake, grab it with a
pair of work gloves, and let it go outside. If the

MASSACHUSETTS SNAKES
small animals, garter snakes’ primary prey are earthworms
and amphibians. Their saliva appears to be toxic to
amphibians and other small animals and a bite may
produce swelling or a burning rash in some people.
Although garter snakes may or may not bite if handled,
most individuals secrete a foul-smelling fluid from anal
glands when alarmed. Occasionally, garter snakes make
their way into basements, a situation that appears to be
most common in spring and autumn.

environment they may
become dormant until conditions
improve. Ribbon snakes are
comfortable both in and out of water
and are adept swimmers. They may be
found basking on logs, hummocks or
muskrat lodges, and escape rapidly into dense
cover or open water if threatened. Ribbon snakes rarely
bite if handled, but they do secrete a foul musk from their
anal glands when alarmed.
stripe pattern
8
* The word 'keeled' indicates that on most scales on the snake’s body, there is a ridge running the length of each scale. A snake with
keeled scales has a rougher look and feel than a smooth scaled snake.
stripe pattern
Generally, you can recognize this most
common of all New England snakes by its pattern
of yellow stripes on a black or brown background.
Although the pattern is variable, it usually consists of a
narrow stripe down the middle of the back and a broad
stripe on each side. Between the center and each side
stripe are two rows of alternating black spots. A dark line
separating the yellow side stripe from the belly is not
particularly bold as it is in the ribbon snake. Background
color is usually brown or black, but may be somewhat
green or reddish. Stripes may be tan, yellow or orange. A
garter snake will occasionally appear more checkered
than striped. The scales are keeled* and the belly is
yellow or pale green.
Garter snakes generally mate after emerging from
hibernation in March or April. Females give birth to 12-40
young anytime from July through October.
Garter snakes occupy a variety of habitats including
pond and stream edges, wetlands, forests, fields, rocky
hillsides and residential areas. They are often observed as
they bask on rocks, wood piles, stone walls, hedges and
swimming pool decks. Although they feed on a variety of
Eastern Ribbon Snake
Thamnophis sauritus (18-26", up to 38")
The ribbon snake is a very slender, striped
snake, similar in appearance to the garter snake but
with a much longer tail. Tail length for the ribbon
snake generally accounts for one third or more of total
body length. It is boldly patterned with three yellow
stripes on a reddish-brown background. A distinct dark
band separates each side stripe from the belly. The
ribbon snake has keeled scales and a belly that is pale
yellow or pale green.
Ribbon snakes generally mate in the spring
(April-May), after emerging from hibernation,
and females give birth to 10-12 young in
July or August.
The preferred habitats of ribbon snakes are
wetlands and the edges of ponds and streams.
Amphibians, especially frogs, are their preferred
food, although fish and insects are also taken. Given their
preference for wet habitats, ribbon snakes tend to be most
active during the spring. If summer weather dries up their

Named for a yellow band around the neck, the ringneck
snake is relatively easy to identify when encountered. Its
back is either slate gray, black or brown with smooth
scales giving it a satin-like appearance. A complete yellow
ring just behind the
head, along with smooth
scales, distinguishes it
from redbelly or juvenile
brown snakes. The belly

Ringneck Snake
Diadophis punctatus (10-15", up to 27")
is bright yellow or rarely orange, and may occasionally
bear a few small black spots.
Mating takes place in spring or fall, with 3-4 eggs (up
to ten) laid in June or early July. Eggs are about 1" long
and are deposited together under rocks or other cover, in
rotting logs and stumps, mulch piles or small mammal
burrows. Hatchlings emerge in August or September.
Ringneck snakes prefer moist woodlands as
their habitat. This is also habitat for an important
prey item, redback salamanders. Although salamanders
make up the bulk of their diet, ringnecks will also feed on
earthworms, insects and, on occasion, fish. As relatively
small snakes, they rarely bask in the open and are gener-
ally found under cover (rocks, logs, boards, debris) during
the day. Like the salamanders on which they prey, ring-
necks are usually nocturnal. They are most active in spring
and fall and are rarely seen during summer. Among all the
New England snakes, ringnecks are most likely to end up
in someone’s basement. Ringneck snakes rarely bite, but
may release a foul musk when handled.
Although woodlands
are preferred habitats,
redbelly snakes are also
found in fields, bogs
and wet meadows, as
well as along the
borders of marshes,
swamps, 
ponds and
streams. They are small and
secretive snakes and spend
most of their time hiding
under rocks, logs, boards or
debris, or within rotted stumps.
Slugs make up the bulk of their
diet, with earthworms, sow bugs,
soft-bodied insects and small frogs
also taken. Redbellys are active during
the daytime in spring and fall, but restrict
their activities to twilight and nighttime
during the summer. When handled,
redbelly snakes may curl their upper lips
and show their teeth; however, they rarely bite.
If sufficiently disturbed they will release musk from
anal glands.
Mating may
occur in spring,
summer or fall, but
most matings prob-
ably take place in
spring after redbellys
emerge from hiber-
nation in April. Their young are born alive, typically
from late July through early September, with 4-9
snakes to a brood.
Redbelly Snake
Storeria occipitomaculata (8-10", up to 16")
Both the common and scientific
names for this small snake refer to
characteristics that help identify it.
‘Occipitomaculata’ refers to three
light spots located just behind the
head. Redbelly generally describes
the color of the underside, al-
though the color can vary from
yellow (rarely), to orange to red.
The overall color of this snake is also
variable, and it can be brown,
bronze, slate gray or, rarely,
black. Occasionally the three spots
behind the head may be fused into a
ring. The redbelly has keeled scales,
distinguishing it from the smooth-scaled ringneck snake.
keeled scales

keeled scales
Status: “Threatened.” Illegal to harass, kill, collect or possess.
True to its name, the brown snake is dark
brown to grayish brown in color. It generally
has a broad light stripe bordered by dark spots
down the back. The belly is pink or buff
colored, sometimes with rows of small black
spots. As a juvenile it has a light ring around
the neck. However, unlike the ringneck snake,
the brown snake has keeled scales.
Brown snakes emerge from hibernation
after the ground thaws in the spring. They
typically mate in spring or early summer, and
8-20 young are born alive from mid-July through
August. Although they are generally forced into
hibernation by November, brown snakes may emerge
briefly during periods of warm winter weather.
Found in a variety of wild habitats such as wetlands,
grasslands and forests, brown snakes are most often
encountered in urban or residential areas. It is not uncom-
mon to find several (or many) brown snakes under debris
in vacant lots, parks and cemeteries. Earthworms and slugs
are their preferred foods; however, they will also take sow
bugs, insects, spiders, small fish and small frogs. They are
active during the daytime in
spring and fall, but are primarily
nocturnal during the summer. Brown snakes
rarely bite but, like most snakes, will release musk from
their anal glands when alarmed.
Brown Snake
Storeria dekayi (9-13", up to 20")
This small burrowing snake shares a superficial resem-
blance to an earthworm. The worm snake is an unpat-
terned brown snake with a pink belly, pointed head and
small eyes. Smooth scales give it a shiny, iridescent
quality, and readily distinguish it from brown and redbelly
snakes that have keeled scales.
Worm snakes appear to mate in the fall.
Females store the sperm over winter and use
it to fertilize eggs in the spring or early
summer. Eggs are deposited under
rocks or inside mulch piles, rotting
logs or stumps. A typical clutch
consists of 2-5 small eggs. Eggs laid in June and early July
generally hatch in August and September.
In Massachusetts, worm snakes have been found only
in the southern Connecticut Valley where they prefer areas
with sandy soil. Moist woodlands with either sandy or
rocky soils provide the best habitat. They feed almost
exclusively on earthworms, although other small slender
prey such as salamanders, fly larvae and slugs are occasion-
ally taken. Rarely seen in the open, worm snakes may be
found under rocks and logs, but are often underground.
Worm snakes are intolerant of dry conditions and often
disappear from areas that have been cleared of vegetation.
During the summer, they burrow deep into the ground or
seek shelter under rocks or in rotting stumps or logs, and
remain inactive until conditions improve. In hand, worm
snakes will use their heads and hard pointed tails to probe,
as if burrowing, for an escape route. They rarely bite but do
produce a pungent odor from their anal glands.

The racer is the only
large, black snake in
New England with
smooth scales. Its chin,
throat and jaw are white or gray and the belly is gener-
ally dark (gray, bluish, or black) from the throat back.
Smooth scales give this snake a silky or satin-like
appearance. A juvenile racer is gray with large brown,
black or reddish blotches down the back, small spots
along the sides and large dark eyes. The pattern fades
with age, disappearing when the snake reaches 25-30
inches in length.
Racers mate in the spring, and females deposit 10-12
eggs in small mammal burrows, under rocks or logs, or in
mulch piles or rotting logs. Eggs laid in
June or July normally hatch in August
and September.
Black racers are common snakes
that utilize a variety of habitats includ-
ing rocky ledges, pastures, overgrown
fields, dry or moist woodlands and the edges
of wetlands. Small
mammals, other
snakes and insects are
preferred food items,
although racers take a
wide variety of prey.
They will even feed on
young of their own
species. Active primarily during the day, racers are com-
monly seen as they bask on shrubs, rocks, ledges and
roads, and are tolerant of summer temperatures that
would drive other snakes to seek shelter. Aptly named,
racers are very fast and typically flee from danger. However,
once cornered they put up a vigorous fight, biting hard and
often. Rattling their tails among dry leaves, racers can sound
convincingly like rattlesnakes. If captured they are difficult to
handle and will writhe, defecate and spray musk in an
attempt to escape.

Black Racer
Coluber constrictor (36-60", up to 73")
A juvenile rat snake is gray with light spots running
down the middle of the back, and has white eyes. This
pattern darkens with age and is generally undetectable
once the snake reaches a length of three feet.
Mating generally takes place in the spring, with 10-14
eggs laid in June or July. Eggs deposited beneath rocks
or in manure piles, rotting vegetation, stumps or logs
generally hatch in August and September.
Exceedingly rare in Massachusetts, black rat snakes have
been found only in the Connecticut Valley and southern
Worcester County, where they occupy rocky ledges and
forested hillsides. Mammals, birds and bird eggs make up the
bulk of their diet and rat snakes will readily climb trees to
raid bird and squirrel
nests. Young rat
snakes feed on frogs
and other small prey.
Black rat snakes
readily bask in the
open during spring
and fall. Although they are not particularly aggressive, they
may bite, defecate or spray musk when handled. Tail rattling
may lead some people to mistake them for rattlesnakes.
Our largest snake, the black rat snake can reach a length of
eight feet, but is usually much smaller. The adult snake is
black with a white or creamy yellow chin and throat. In
contrast to the black racer, the belly of a rat snake is a
mixture of light and dark, giving a somewhat mottled
appearance. Light areas are often apparent between scales,
and the scales on the back are weakly keeled.

Illegal to harass, kill, collect or possess.
Smooth Green Snake
Opheodrys vernalis (12-20", up to 26")
Unpatterned and green above, white to pale yellow
below, the smooth green snake is difficult to confuse
with any other snake in Massachusetts. Young snakes are
dark olive or blue-gray in color and could be confused
with young black racers except that racers have a mottled
pattern when young. The smooth green snake has scales
that are not keeled.
Green snakes emerge in April or May and mate in the
late spring or summer. Eggs are laid from June to Septem-
ber, perhaps in two clutches of 4-6 eggs. Females probably
incubate the eggs inside their bodies before depositing
them in rodent burrows, sawdust piles, mounds of rotting
vegetation or rotting logs. As a result, the eggs hatch 4-23
days after they are laid, a short period of time relative to
other snakes.
Areas that support a ground cover of thick green
vegetation are the preferred habitats of green snakes.
Fields, wet meadows, bogs, marsh edges and open wood-
lands provide the kind of concealment cover required by
these small snakes. Active during the day, green snakes
feed on a variety of arthropods (crickets,
grasshoppers, caterpillars, beetles, spiders, centipedes and
millipedes). Green snakes rarely bite when handled and
when they do, rarely break the skin. If handled roughly
enough they will, like other snakes, exude a foul substance
from their anal glands.
A thick-bodied
snake with an upturned
snout, the hognose snake is extremely variable in appear-
ance. Generally a well-patterned snake, its background
color can be yellow, gray, pinkish brown, olive or black,
patterned with large rectangular spots down the middle of
the back alternating with dark spots on each side. Occa-
sionally the pattern is obscured by overall dark coloration.
Individuals of this
species may appear
all black.
Body scales are
keeled and the
underside of the tail
is usually lighter
than the rest of
the belly.
Eastern Hognose Snake
Heterodon platirhinos (20-33", up to 45")
Most matings take place
in the spring. Females typically deposit 15-25
eggs in a depression under rocks or logs, in sandy soil,
or in mulch piles. Eggs deposited in June and July hatch in
August and September.
Sandy soils are an essential habitat characteristic for
hognose snakes. These snakes can be found in sandy
woodlands, fields, farmland and coastal areas. Toads are
their preferred prey, although frogs, salamanders, small
mammals, birds and invertebrates are also taken. Hog-
nose snakes appear to be immune to poisons produced
by toads, and are equipped with large teeth in the back
of their mouths, apparently to puncture inflated toads so
that they may be more easily swallowed. Many of these
harmless snakes are killed by people who are convinced
that they are venomous and dangerous. When confronted,
the hognose snake will suck in air, spread the skin
around its head and neck like a cobra, hiss, and lunge as
if to strike. Despite this rather convincing show, hognose
snakes almost never bite. They will often feign death if
provoked enough.

Milk Snake
Lampropeltis triangulum (24-36", up to 52")

smooth scales
insects. Primarily nocturnal,
milk snakes can be found during
the day under rocks, logs, or other cover. Although they
are not very aggressive, milk snakes will bite and spray
musk if handled.
A boldly patterned snake, the milk snake has a light gray to
tan body covered with reddish-brown blotches bordered in
black. Larger blotches on the back alternate with smaller
ones on each side. The head is patterned, usually with a
light colored “Y” or “V” within a reddish-brown patch.
Smooth scales give this attractive snake a shiny or
glossy appearance. The belly is patterned with an
irregular checkerboard of black on white. Similarity
of patterns causes some to confuse it with the
copperhead; however, the copperhead lacks any
pattern on the head. Tail rattling may also lead
some to mistake it for a rattlesnake, although the
two species look quite different.
Mating generally occurs in May, with females
depositing 3-24 eggs in June and July. Eggs are
deposited under rocks, boards or other debris, in
rotting vegetation, stumps or logs, or small mammal
burrows, and usually hatch in August and September.
Woodlands, fields, rocky hillsides and borders of
wetlands provide natural habitat for milk snakes. They are
also commonly found around houses, barns and outbuild-
ings. Small mammals are the preferred prey of milk snakes,
who are able to enter burrows and consume young in their
nests. Milk snakes routinely eat other snakes, and may also
take birds and bird eggs, frogs, fish, earthworms, slugs and
This thick-bodied snake is
quite variable in color and pattern.
Background color ranges from light gray
to dark brown. It is almost always patterned
with reddish-brown, brown or black crossbands near
the head and alternating back and side blotches farther
down the body. The pattern generally becomes less
noticeable as the water snake grows larger, and often
results in a uniformly dark snake. Body scales are
strongly keeled and the belly is patterned with black or
orange crescents.
Courtship and mating typically occur in May
and June, and females give birth to 20-40 young in
August and September.
True to their name, water snakes are found in
a variety of wet habitats including lakes, ponds,
rivers, streams and wetlands. They are excellent
swimmers, both on the surface or submerged,
and commonly forage along the water’s edge for
prey. Fish, frogs, tadpoles and salamanders
make up the bulk of their diet, though they
will also take small
mammals, birds, insects, crayfish and other invertebrates.
Water snakes are very common and can often be found
basking on beaver dams and lodges, bridge abutments,
banks and shrubs. In the spring, water snakes are com-
monly reported by homeowners who find them in their
backyards. When threatened, they rapidly retreat to water.
If cornered, they do not hesitate to strike. Water snakes
can almost always be counted on to bite, defecate and
spray a particularly foul-smelling musk when handled.

for most of
the prey
items taken,
but birds, insects
and other snakes are
also important parts of their diets. When approached, they
will either move away quietly or lay motionless, relying on
camouflage to protect them. Occasionally, they will vibrate
their tails. Bites usually occur when people unknowingly
step on or touch unseen snakes. Despite the 
venomous
nature of copperhead bites, they are rarely fatal. In Massa-
chusetts, copperheads are so rare and reclusive that people
almost never encounter them.
The copperhead is a venomous snake with a broad tri-
angular head, vertically elliptical pupils and a heat sensitive
pit between each eye and nostril. The body is pinkish to
grayish brown with brown or reddish-brown crossbands
that are narrow on the back and widest on the sides.
Small dark spots commonly occur between crossbands on
the back. The unpatterned head is dull orange, copper or
rusty-red. Body scales are keeled and the belly is pink or
light brown with dark blotches along the sides. When
young, a copperhead has a yellow-tipped tail.
Mating takes place in spring and fall and females give
birth to 4-8 young in August and September. Adult
females usually give birth every two years.
Copperheads prefer
rocky, forested hillsides
and wetlands for habitat.

sought out in the hot
summer months. Small

Timber Rattlesnake
Crotalus horridus (36-60", up to 74")
Status: “Endangered.” Illegal to harass, kill, collect or possess.
A robust, venomous snake, the timber rattler is
equipped with a broad triangular head, vertical pupils and
heat sensitive pits. The body color may be yellow, gray,
dark brown or black, with dark, V-shaped crossbands
across the back. The pattern may not be obvious if the
body is very dark. The head is usually unpatterned and is
covered with many small scales. A distinct rattle on the
end of a darkly colored tail produces a buzzing sound
when vibrated. When young, the rattlesnake has only a
small button on the tail. Body scales are strongly keeled
and the light colored belly is flecked with dark spots.
Mating usually occurs in
summer or fall. Females incubate
eggs within their bodies by bask-
ing, and give birth the following
year to 6-10 young from mid-
August through September. Female
rattlesnakes typically give birth
every two or three years.
Although rocky forested hill-
sides with southern exposures are
essential as winter habitat, rattle-
snakes prefer dense forests with a thick understory for
foraging. They
bask during the day and forage at night, when prey is
most abundant. Rattlesnakes prey on a variety of warm-
blooded animals, including: mice, chipmunks and other
squirrels, rabbits, shrews, moles, weasels and birds.
Occasionally, rattlesnakes will also feed on insects, am-
phibians and other snakes. When threatened, they vibrate
their tails to produce a loud buzzing sound that is difficult
to miss. They are not particularly aggressive and bites are
rare. In Massachusetts, rattlesnakes are so rare that they are
almost never encountered by people.

There are no safe, effective snake repellents
capable of keeping snakes away from yards or

180 days. In addition, anyone killing an endan-
gered species may be required to make a

Commonwealth is very serious about protecting
the priceless natural heritage these animals
represent to present and future generations. If you
observe one of these rare snakes in Massachusetts,
report it to the Natural Heritage and Endangered
Species Program, (508) 792-7270.
Common species may be hunted, trapped or
captured up to a possession limit of two. This
“loophole” was deliberately left open so that
budding biologists and snake enthusiasts could
capture and study a few of the animals if they
wished. However, many snakes do not adapt well
to captivity. Curiosity can generally be satisfied
through a few days of observation, after which the
snake should be released in the same place it was
found. It is illegal to transport and release (“translo-
cate”) any wild animal in Massachusetts. Although
it is not illegal to kill common snakes, there is
generally no reason for anyone to do so.
All snakes receive some protection under the
Fisheries and Wildlife Laws and Regulations of the
state of Massachusetts. They are protected as
important members of our native wildlife commu-
nities and as valuable natural resources. None of
them may be taken from the wild for purposes of
sale. To report any violations of our wildlife laws,
call toll free: 1-800-632-8075.
Our rare snakes are stringently protected under
the laws and regulations already mentioned, as
well as under the Massachusetts Endangered
Species Act. Four species are involved: the worm
snake, black rat snake, copperhead and timber
rattlesnake. None of these may be collected, killed
or held in possession except under special permit.
(Although it is not presently listed under the
Massachusetts Endangered Species Act, the hog-
nose snake is also specifically protected from
killing, collection and possession.) The penalties
for killing, collecting, possessing or even harassing
these species — some of which have declined
dramatically due to illegal collection — can range
